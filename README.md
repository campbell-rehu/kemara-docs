# kemara-docs

This repo is for my personal documentation where I write about things I have learned. The built site can be found at [here](https://kemara-docs.vercel.app/).

This is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
